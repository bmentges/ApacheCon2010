Building Blocks: Acquisition and Extraction

- Acquisition:
* Nutch
* Solr DIH (Data Import Handler)
* ManifoldCF

- Extraction
* Tika (PDFBox, POI, etc)

Building Blocks: Language Analysis

- Basics:
* Morphology, Tokenization, Stemming/Lemmatization, Language Detection
* Lucene has extensive support, plus pluggable

- Intermediate:
* Phrases, Part of Speech, Collocations, Shallow Parsing...
* Lucene, Mahout, OpenNLP

- Advanced:
* Concepts, Sentiment, Relationships, Deep parsing...
* Machine Learning Tools like Mahout

Building Blocks: Domain Knowledge

- You, Your Business, Your Requirements
* Focus groups

- Examples:
* Synonyms, taxonomies
* Genre (sublanguage: jargon, abbreviations, etc)
* Content relationships (explicit and implicit links)
* Metadata: locaiton, time, authorship, content type

Building Blocks: Search

- Main interface which users interact with a system
* Doesnt require explicit typing in of keywords
* Sometimes a search need not be a search

- Less frequently used capabilities become more important:
* Pluggable Query Parsing
* Spans/Payloads
* Terms, TermVectors

- Lucene/Solr can actually stand-in for many of the higher layers (organizational)

Building Blocks: Organization / Discovery

- Organization
* Classification (named entity extraction)
* Clustering (Collection, Search Results)
* Topic Modeling
* Summarization (Document, Collection)

- Discovery/Guidance
* Faceting/Clusters
* Auto-suggest
* Did you mean ?
* Related Searches
* More Like This

Building Blocks: Relationships

- Harness multilevel relationships
* Doc <-> Doc:
** excplicit (links and citations, etc),
** implicit: shared concepts
* User <-> Doc: read/rated/reviewed/shared
* User <-> User:
** explicit: friend, colleague, reports to, friend of friend.
** implicit: email, instant msg, asked/answered question

Building Blocks: Users

- History
* Saved Searches -> Deeper analysis -> Alerts

- Profile
* Likes/Dislikes
* Location
* Roles

- Enhance/Restrict queries, personalize scoring/ranking/recommendations

Building Blocks: Aggregating Analysis

- You're an engineer, do you know what's in your production logs ?

- Log analysis
* Who, what, when, where, why ?
* Hadoop, Pig, Mahout, etc

- Classification/Clustering
* Label/Group users based on their interactions
** Power users, new users, etc.
** Mahout and other machine learning techniques

Tying it Together

- Key Extension Points
* Analyzer Chain
* UpdateProcessor (indexing side)
* Request Handler
* SearchComponent
* Qparser (plugin)
* Event Listeners
